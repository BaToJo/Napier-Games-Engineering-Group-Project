1. Download InnoSetup. You can just google for it. It's a bit of free software.

2. Use InnoSetup to open the .iss script file that is in this folder.

3. Use the "Build" menu at the top of the screen to compile the script.

It will place the .exe installer ready for use inside the "setup_files" folder in this folder.
You can give that .exe to any user and they can use it to install the game.

The file "pre_install_info.txt" will be shown to users at the start of installation, before they install. You can modify that text file to change what is shown to users.

You can replace the file "icon.ico" with an .ico file of your choice to make it the setup icon.
