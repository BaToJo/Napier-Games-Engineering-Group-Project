This game contains a comical satire of murder and violence against innocent people, and expects the player to perform violent acts on computer-controlled characters who resemble innocent people. Nobody gets visibly hurt or killed on screen, and there is no visible bodily harm or blood, but it is implied to be a consequence of the player's actions. The violence is designed to be comical and exaggerated, and is not intended to resemble any real event. Any resemblence between real events and events depicted in the game, or real people and characters depicted in the game, or real brands and brands depicted in the game, is purely coincidental.
